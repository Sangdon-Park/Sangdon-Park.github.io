# Apartment Representative Work Enhanced by AI

Since last September, I've been serving as an apartment representative alongside my main job and childcare responsibilities. What started as a simple desire to solve problems in our apartment complex has turned into a challenging journey filled with complex and sometimes unreasonable situations.

Fortunately, AI technology has been an invaluable assistant, and recently our proposal for the 'Yuseong Magic Community Activation Project' was selected. While I'm delighted about managing this 4-million-won project over the next six months, I also feel the weight of adding this to my already full schedule. Nevertheless, the experience of utilizing AI LLM over the past 8 months has been so valuable that I wanted to share insights on how AI can be effectively applied in daily life.

## 1. Efficient Analysis and Management of Vast Information

Being an apartment representative involves dealing with countless reports, regulations, complaints, and real-time group chats. Sometimes deliberately distorted or incomplete information made problem identification even more difficult. I used AI to quickly analyze and summarize this information.

For example, during the elevator rope replacement controversy, I used AI to thoroughly analyze conflicting technical reports quickly, identifying the problems with the absurd claim that "the entire elevator needs replacement" with objective data, preparing materials that perfectly refuted such claims.

I converted long meeting recordings and phone calls to text and summarized them for efficient information sharing, and even summarized KakaoTalk conversations to track key discussion flows. I also used AI to quickly search for success stories from other apartments and related support programs for cultural program planning.

## 2. Data-Driven Rational Decision Making

Without AI's objective information analysis capabilities, I might have been swayed by cleverly distorted information or emotional arguments. By visualizing and analyzing employee turnover data with AI, I clearly identified patterns of increased resignation rates after specific periods, which became strong evidence for fundamental solutions like hiring new administrative staff.

For gym facility repairs, when proposals tried to inflate simple repairs into full renovations, I used AI to compare costs and methods of similar cases, presenting cost-effective alternatives. I also used AI to analyze resident survey results for cultural programs, helping to specify project proposals and make data-driven rational decisions.

AI's ability to help secure clear data evidence against irrational claims or suspicious intentions was particularly valuable, providing tireless support in creating materials without emotional drain.

## 3. Time Saving and Work Efficiency

With weekdays filled with office work and evenings and weekends dedicated to childcare, handling representative duties required maximum time efficiency. AI tools made it possible to accomplish tasks that would have been physically impossible otherwise.

I quickly drafted meeting minutes and official documents with AI, and rapidly processed complex Excel work and data organization with AI assistance. Even professional content like legal reviews and regulation checks were pre-screened with AI to save time.

Especially during non-regular hours like early mornings or weekends, I could process work using AI, allowing me to fulfill my representative role while preserving family time.

## 4. Effective Communication and Persuasion

With AI's help, I could organize complex content into easily understandable formats for residents. Even in emotionally charged situations, I used AI's objective and neutral expressions to ease conflicts and lead to constructive discussions.

When writing project proposals, I used AI to create logical and persuasive content, ultimately achieving selection success.

## 5. Continuous Learning and Growth

The representative role required knowledge in various fields including architecture, law, and accounting. Through AI, I could quickly learn and apply necessary information. This became an opportunity to expand my capabilities beyond simple task processing.

## Conclusion

AI is more than just a tool; it's a powerful partner that helps make rational judgments and efficiently solve problems in complex situations. Especially for modern people juggling multiple roles with limited time and resources, AI is becoming an indispensable tool.

I hope these experiences from my representative activities help those looking to solve daily problems using AI. With AI, I believe we can all create better changes together.
